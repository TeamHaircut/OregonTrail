			To ford a river means to pull your wagon across a<br> 
			shallow part of the river, with the oxen still attached.<br><br>

			To caulk the wagon means to seal it so that<br>
			no water can get in. The wagon can then be <br>
			floated across like a boat.<br><br>

			To use a ferry means to put your wagon on top <br>
			of a flat boat that belongs to someone else.<br>
			The owner of the ferry will take your wagon <br>
			across the river for a price, however you might <br>
 			have to wait a couple of days.<br><br>
